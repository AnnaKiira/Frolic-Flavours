Frolic Flavours is a web application that allows users to create their own accounts, upload their own recipes, and view recipes shared by other users on the app. 
The app includes a favourites feature, enabling users to save their preferred recipes and easily access them on their profile page. 
On your profile page, you can also see the recipes you've created.
This makes it easy to find your own recipes and revisit your favourites for future cooking.

I chose to build this recipe-sharing app because I love cooking, especially with loved ones. Working on a project related to my interests made the process really enjoyable and fun.

Planning was an important step before starting building the app.
- Here is a link to the deployed app: https://frolicflavours.netlify.app
- Here is a link to my planning materials: https://trello.com/b/QFiNx5aE/crud-project 

The Trello board includes User Stories, a Routing Table, an ER-Diagram, Wireframes and other ToDo's. This organized my approach in developing a functional and visually appealing app.

Technologies used:
- JavaScript, CSS, EJS and MongoDB was used to build and complete this project.

Key Learnings:
- After this project, I felt way more comfortable building full-stack applications, and I understood how CRUD operations work much better once I had developed my own app.
- I had fun setting up authentication and authorization. It was cool to build and see how only specific features could be accessed if you were authenticated and how user-specific data could only be edited or deleted if you were authorized to do so.

Future Improvements:
- Some of my stretch goals for future enhancements are adding images to recipes as visuals are important when choosing a recipe to cook. So when a user creates a post, it's possible for them to also upload an image of the recipe they want to share.
- Implementing advanced search options and filtering. This would be a great way to allow users to find recipes without having to scroll through the entire app. For example, if someone is looking for pasta recipes, they could use the filter in the search function to display only pasta recipes.
