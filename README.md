Frolic Flavours - Discover Delicious Recipes Shared by Users. 

Insert Screenshot of App Here:

Frolic Flavours is an app that allows users to create their own accounts, upload their own recipes, and view recipes shared by other users on the app. 
The app includes a favourites feature, enabling users to save their preferred recipes and easily access them on their profile page. 
On your profile page, you can also see the recipes you've created.
This makes it easy to find your own recipes and revisit your favourites for future cooking.

I chose to build this recipe-sharing app because I love cooking, especially with loved ones. Working on a project related to my interests made the process really enjoyable.

Planning was an important step before starting building the app.
- Here is a link to the deployed app: https://main--frolicflavours.netlify.app/
- Here is a link to my planning materials: https://trello.com/b/QFiNx5aE/crud-project 

The Trello board includes User Stories, a Routing Table, an ER-Diagram, Wireframes and other functionalities needed for my app to work and look good.

Technologies used:
- JavaScript, CSS, EJS and MongoDB was used to build and complete this project.

Stretch Goals: 
- Some of my stretch goals for future enhancements are adding images to recipes as visuals are important when choosing a recipe to cook.
- Implementing advanced search options and filtering would be a great enhancement. This would allow users to find recipes without having to scroll through the entire app. For example, if someone is looking for pasta recipes, they could use the filter in the search function to display only pasta recipes.
